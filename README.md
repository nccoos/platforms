Observing Platforms

This repository is used for managing projects with observing platforms.  Some of the aspects managed here include data acquisition software, system builds, remote communication, mooring hardware, sensor calibrations, purchases, and other logistics such as permits and vessel reservations.  Issues are created for the tasks needed to be done for a particular milestone.  Milestones generally are defined goals like deployments, operation and maintenance period, and recovery.  Projects provide a way to manage and visualize the milestones and issues related to each project.  There is some code in this repository, but the main focus is on managing all aspects of getting platforms setup with sensors, ensuring data acquisition, storage, and communication, the physical connections, and maintain structure integrity of each platform.  The platforms can be buoys, gliders, towers, ships or anything that can hold sensors and sensor packages and may be stationary or mobile.
